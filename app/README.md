#  Application  Development

1. The completed code is in main.py file and uses the local storage for loading the models instead of downloading it everytime whenever we are starting the container.
2. Best practices for the Dockerfile and the python script is done and mentioned inline with the comments.
3. Added python modules to requirments file which I used to complete the script.
4. Generated  the openapi.json from the swagger UI and converted that into swagger format too (swagger.yaml)
5. Built locally the docker image and pushed here: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/narayanannsuku1212/translator-service 
6. Used the same docker image in the k8s deployment too.
